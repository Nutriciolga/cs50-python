#In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts
# the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase.
# Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. Youâ€™re welcome,
# but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

# The user is required to enter the text
i = input("Enter the text:")
# All text is converted to lowercase and printed out
print(i.lower())
