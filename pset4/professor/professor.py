# In a file called professor.py, implement a program that:

# Prompts the user for a level, . If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again.
# Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = ,
# wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with  digits. No need to support operations other than addition (+).
# Prompts the user to solve each of those problem. If an answer is not correct
# (or not even a number), the program should output EEE and prompt the user again,
# allowing the user up to three tries in total. If the user has still not answered
# correctly after three tries, the program should output the correct answer.
# The program should ultimately output the userâ€™s score, a number out of 10.
# Structure your program as follows, wherein get_level prompts (and, if need be, re-prompts)
# the user for a level and returns 1, 2, or 3, and generate_integer returns a randomly
# generated non-negative integer with level digits or raises a ValueError if level is not 1, 2, or 3:
